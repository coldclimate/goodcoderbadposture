Poor posture isn’t just limited to coders, all the IT work can get involved!  Here we see Joel Reiser, project manager and all round top chap.  In his own words.. 

“Not sure you can tell from the picture, but I’m sitting on my knees with my arms over the back of my steno desk chair.  I don’t do this too often, but I do it more often than I should…”

That’s right, kneeing, facing backwards, spine at a jaunty angle, everybody an make this work for them
