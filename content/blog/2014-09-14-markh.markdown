Here we see [Mark Hemmings](http://twitter.com/mhemmings), who joined us as a summer intern, being almost 14 feet 3 inches tall we didnt get him a raised desk or proper chair preferring to see him using the tried and tested wall'n'knee combo.

For the record Mark remains the more talented student programmer Iâ€™ve ever worked with by a country mile.
